90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence with no obvious errors. No. of
    poems and no. of lines consistent w/ printed edition. From poem no. 70
    the number is out by +1 (e.g., poem 70 should be 69, etc.). Poetry might
    best be annotated via a Regex. Pagination numbers failed on the first
    few pages, otherwise OK.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
